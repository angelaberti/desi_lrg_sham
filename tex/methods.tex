DECaLS DR9 photometry
photo-zs from Zhu+ 2020
treat north and south regions separately (different filters used for each)

apparent z-band magnitude cut: mz < 21.0 (Zhu+ 2020 estimate for reliable photo-zs)

bin data by photoz: (0.3,0.4), (0.4,0.5), (0.5,0.6), etc.

K-correct g,r,z,W1(,W2) magnitudes to zsnap of relevant simulation (e.g. zsnap=0.33028 for (0.3,0.4) photoz data bin); Blanton+ 2007 (ref) K-correct package with DECam (grz) and WISE (W1,W2) filters


% Methods

Compute ng_eff(< Mx) = sum( 1 / (survey_angular_area*V_eff) ); V_eff = volume corresponding to max redshift at which galaxy would have been observed by the survey
