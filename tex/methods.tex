% Data

DECaLS DR9 photometry
photo-zs from Zhu+ 2020
treat north and south regions separately (different filters used for each)

apparent z-band magnitude cut: mz < 21.0 (Zhu+ 2020 estimate for reliable photo-zs)

bin data by photo-z: (0.3,0.4), (0.4,0.5), (0.5,0.6), etc.

K-correct g,r,z,W1,W2 magnitudes to zsnap of relevant simulation (e.g. zsnap=0.33028 for (0.3,0.4) photo-z data bin); Blanton+ 2007 (ref) K-correct package with DECam (grz) and WISE (W1,W2) filters

250 Mpc/h cubic box


% Methods
Estimate ng_eff(< Mz) = survey_area*sum(1/V_eff); V_eff = volume corresponding to max redshift at which galaxy would could have been observed by the survey
